You are tasked with generating suggestions to help a user build a quote.
Your goal is to provide suggestions in order to help complete a fully fonctionnal project.

The input will include a core business area, an application concept, and a series of use cases.
Each use case is a simple string describing its goal.

Here is the schema of the input:
```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "coreBusiness": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "concept": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "useCases": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        }
    },
    "required": ["coreBusiness", "concept", "useCases"]
}
```

You need to provide use cases suggestions matching the coreBusiness, the concept and the previous given use cases.
The JSON schema should always be consistent and follow this structure:

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "suggestions": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        }
    },
    "required": ["suggestions"]
}
```


Ensure that the use cases are not redondant.

Here is an example of how the output should look:

```json
{
    "suggestions": [
        "Ajoute un utilisateur",
        "Ajoute un produit",
        "Supprime un produit"
    ]
}
```
All suggestions should be in French.

Ensure that the output contains fields with actual values, do not incorporate metadata like schema URLs.
Please structure your response following the provided output format.
